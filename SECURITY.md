## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in this project, please report it to us privately. Do **not** create a public issue.

You can report vulnerabilities in either of the following ways:

- Use the “Report a vulnerability” option under the **Security** tab of the GitHub repository to open a private security advisory with the maintainers.
- If you prefer email, contact the maintainers at the security contact listed in the project documentation, including the word “SECURITY” in the subject line.

When reporting, please include:

- A description of the vulnerability and the components or versions affected
- Steps to reproduce the issue (proof of concept code or configuration, if possible)
- Any known impact, such as data exposure, privilege escalation, or remote code execution
- Any suggested remediation or workaround, if you have one

We aim to acknowledge receipt of your report within **3 business days**. You can expect further updates at least every **7 business days** while we investigate.

After triage, we will:

- Assess the severity and scope of the issue
- Develop and test a fix, if the vulnerability is confirmed
- Coordinate a release that includes the fix
- Credit you as the reporter if you wish, subject to responsible disclosure practices

If we determine that the reported issue is not a security vulnerability, we will explain why and, where appropriate, may track it as a regular bug instead.
